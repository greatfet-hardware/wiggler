# GreatFET Wiggler

The Wiggler is a small but very important tool! It is easy to connect neighbors (add-on boards) to Azalea, but, with up to 100 pins connected, friction can make neighbors difficult to remove without bending pins. The Wiggler allows you to safely lever a neighbor off of your Azalea in all four corners, avoiding bent pins and keeping your neighbors safe and happy. Itâ€™s extra-neighborly!
